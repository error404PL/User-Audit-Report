User Audit Report Sitecore Module
===========

Module adds new app on Sitecore Dashboard, allowing to check reports of content changes made by the authors. It gathers information from content managing events like save or copy items and collects them in MongoDB.

Results can be displayed using filters to select only one user for instance. Module contains also settings node in `system/modules/Users Audit Reports` where you can select which roles have to be tracked during building the reports. Itâ€™s done by new custom `RolesMultilist` field.
